I am a software engineer with electronics background and current focus on embedded systems. 
I am experienced in microcontroller programming with a focus on connectivity, but I am also interested in embedded Linux and backend development for IoT projects.

## Hard Skills

- Embedded software (Microcontroller)
    - Programming languages: Mainly C/C++, exploring Rust
    - Hardware platforms: STM32, nRF52, ESP32
    - RTOS/Frameworks: Mbed OS, FreeRTOS, exploring ESP IDF and Zephyr
    - Build system: CMake
    - GUI: lvgl 
    - OTA and bootloader (MCUboot)
    - Testing: CppUTest
    - CI: GitHub Actions
- Communication technologies and protocols (Connectivity)
    - Peripheral communication: I2C, SPI, UART etc.
    - Industrial: Modbus-RTU, CAN
    - Cellular: LTE modems, LTE-M and NB-IoT
    - Bluetooth LE basics: GAP, GATT
    - Wi-Fi, LoRa basics
    - TCP/IP, USB basics
    - TLS, PKI and cryptography
    - MQTT (AWS IoT)
- Electronics/hardware
    - Past experience with designing PCBs - can navigate datasheets, schematics and layouts
    - Sensors: Energy metering, acceleration, pressure, temperature etc.
    - Actors: LEDs, stepper motors, piezo buzzers
- High-level software
    - Python: Preferred language for any kind of scripting, e.g. device provisioning and testing
    - JavaScript/TypeScript: Developed custom nodes on Node-RED (NodeJS) and Lambda functions on AWS.
    - AWS IoT and accompanying services: CloudWatch, Lambda, S3, CDK
- (Somewhat) Embedded Linux
    - Raspberry Pi standalone and compute module with RPi OS and high-level software (e.g. Python, Node-RED). Some systemd configuration for startup automation.
- Toolkit
    - Desktop OS: Primarily Windows, comfortable with command line, basic Linux knowledge
    - Version control: Git
    - Preferred editor: VS Code
    - Project management: JIRA, Trello
    - Design and documentation: PlantUML, Markdown

## Interests

- Modern system programming languages such as Rust and Zig. I follow blogs and occasionally develop small projects to keep up-to-date. C/C++ is not going anywhere soon, so modern C/C++ too. Keeping an eye on Ada/SPARK for formal verification on safety-critical systems.
- Modern RTOSs such as Zephyr and NuttX. I developed many projects with Mbed OS but since it has been abandoned by Arm, I am exploring alternatives.
- Modern communication technologies such as CoAP and lwm2m.
- Software quality: Static & dynamic analysis, testing, emulation
- Multi-core systems: SMP on MCUs and AMP with Linux-MCU combination.
- Hardware platforms: RISC-V
- (Real) Embedded Linux: I have some experience with Buildroot and Qt5 but I would like to explore deeper embedded Linux with Yocto and driver development.
- Linux desktop OS and tools: Unfortunately Windows was traditionally a prerequisite for embedded development, however I am observing that more and more tools support Linux, so I might try switching to a Linux development machine soon. I know some essential Linux commands but would like to learn more.
- Formal requirements engineering and system design tools (UML/SysML)
- Computer networks and distributed systems
- Technology in general, life-time learning

## Non-interests

- Hardware development
- Web/mobile frontend development
- Archaic programming languages and build systems
- Proprietary/closed-source systems and frameworks
