I am a software engineer with electronics background and current focus on embedded systems, with 5+ years of experience in microcontroller programming and communication protocols.

Passionate about solving problems with technology and automation, developing efficient and reliable systems. Looking for opportunities to work on cutting edge technologies.

Currently working at the engineering firm [Nantis GmbH](https://www.nantis.de), developing firmware for customer projects and the [Gridknight](https://www.gridknight.com) smart plug.

## Interests

- Modern system programming languages such as Rust and Zig
    - I follow blogs and occasionally develop small projects to keep up-to-date.
    - C/C++ is not disappearing soon, so modern C/C++ too.
    - Keeping an eye on Ada/SPARK for formal verification on safety-critical systems.
- Modern RTOSs such as Zephyr and NuttX
    - I developed many projects with Mbed OS but since it has been abandoned by Arm, I am exploring alternatives.
- Emerging communication technologies
    - CoAP, LwM2M, Bluetooth Mesh, Matter etc.
- Software engineering
    - Quality assurance: Static & dynamic analysis, testing, emulation
    - Requirements engineering and system design tools (UML/SysML)
- Open-source software
    - Contributing back to the community
- Multi-core systems
    - SMP on MCUs and AMP with Linux-MCU combination
- Embedded Linux
    - I have some experience with Buildroot and Qt5 but I would like to explore deeper embedded Linux with Yocto and driver development.
- Linux desktop OS and tools
    - Unfortunately Windows was traditionally a prerequisite for embedded development, however I am observing that more and more tools support Linux, so I might try switching to a Linux development machine soon. I know some essential Linux commands but would like to learn more.
- RISC-V architecture
