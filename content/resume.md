I am a software engineer with electronics background and current focus on embedded systems, 
with 5+ years of experience in microcontroller programming and communication protocols. 

Currently working at the engineering firm [Nantis GmbH](https://www.nantis.de), developing firmware for customer projects and the [Gridknight](https://www.gridknight.com) smart plug.

    - AWS IoT and accompanying services: CloudWatch, Lambda, S3, CDK
- (Somewhat) Embedded Linux
    - Raspberry Pi standalone and compute module with RPi OS and high-level software (e.g. Python, Node-RED). Some systemd configuration for startup automation.
- Toolkit
    - Desktop OS: Primarily Windows, comfortable with command line, basic Linux knowledge
    - Version control: Git
    - Preferred editor: VS Code
    - Project management: JIRA, Trello
    - Design and documentation: PlantUML, Markdown

## Interests

- Modern system programming languages such as Rust and Zig
    - I follow blogs and occasionally develop small projects to keep up-to-date.
    - C/C++ is not going anywhere soon, so modern C/C++ too. 
    - Keeping an eye on Ada/SPARK for formal verification on safety-critical systems.
- Modern RTOSs such as Zephyr and NuttX
    - I developed many projects with Mbed OS but since it has been abandoned by Arm, I am exploring alternatives.
- Emerging communication technologies
    - CoAP, LwM2M, Bluetooth Mesh, Matter etc.
- Software engineering
    - Quality assurance: Static & dynamic analysis, testing, emulation
    - Requirements engineering and system design tools (UML/SysML)
- Open-source software
    - Contributing back to the community
- Multi-core systems
    - SMP on MCUs and AMP with Linux-MCU combination
- Embedded Linux
    - I have some experience with Buildroot and Qt5 but I would like to explore deeper embedded Linux with Yocto and driver development.
- Linux desktop OS and tools
    - Unfortunately Windows was traditionally a prerequisite for embedded development, however I am observing that more and more tools support Linux, so I might try switching to a Linux development machine soon. I know some essential Linux commands but would like to learn more.
- RISC-V architecture
